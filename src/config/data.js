      "There exist various psychological theories, each explaining in its own way the processes of artistic creativity or perception. Very few of them, however, have ever been pursued to an end.

Most psychologists worked only on some particular problems of the general theory of art and proceeded in their research from different approaches, following divergent paths, and reaching different conclusions. Without a general idea or a valid methodological principle it is difficult to appraise systematically what psychology has achieved in this direction..",
